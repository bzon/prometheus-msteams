# Overview

A lightweight Go Web Server that accepts POST alert message from Prometheus Alertmanager and sends it to Microsoft Teams Channels using an incoming webhook url.

## Configuration File

It is recommended to use a config file to make the webserver expose multiple request uri that can cater multiple Teams channel webhooks.

```yaml
# /tmp/config.yml
connectors:
- high_priority_channel: "https://outlook.office.com/webhook/xxxx/aaa/bbb"
- low_priority_channel: "https://outlook.office.com/webhook/xxxx/aaa/ccc"
```

## Docker Installation

For a single webhook setup. No need to for a config file.

```bash
docker run -d -p 2000:2000 \
    --name="promteams" \
    -e TEAMS_INCOMING_WEBHOOK_URL="https://outlook.office.com/webhook/xxxx/aaa/bbb" \
    docker.io/bzon/prometheus-msteams:latest
```

For a multiple webhook setup.

```bash
docker run -d -p 2000:2000 \
    --name="promteams" \
    -e CONFIG_FILE=/tmp/config.yml \
    -v /tmp/config.yml:/tmp/config.yml \
    docker.io/bzon/prometheus-msteams:latest
```

## Go Installation

```bash
go get github.com/bzon/prometheus-msteams
prometheus-msteams server --help
```

For a single webhook setup. No need to for a config file.

```bash
prometheus-msteams server -l localhost -p 2000 -w "https://outlook.office.com/webhook/xxxx-xxxx-xxx"
```

For a multiple webhook setup.

```bash
prometheus-msteams server -l localhost -p 2000 -f /tmp/config.yml
```

## Development and Testing

```bash
export GOTEST_TEAMS_INCOMING_WEBHOOK_URL="https://outlook.office.com/webhook/xxxx-xxxx-xxx"
make test
```

## Alert Manager Configuration

You can try [stefanprodan's](https://github.com/stefanprodan) [Prometheus in Docker](https://github.com/stefanprodan/dockprom) to help you setup your Sandbox environment quickly.

Your Alertmanager would have a configuration like these.

For a single webhook setup.

```yaml
route:
  group_by: ['alertname']
  group_interval: 30s
  repeat_interval: 30s
  group_wait: 30s
  receiver: 'prometheus-msteams'

receivers:
- name: 'prometheus-msteams'
  webhook_configs:
  - send_resolved: true
    url: 'http://localhost:2000/alertmanager'
```

For a multiple webhook setup.

```yaml
route:
  group_by: ['alertname']
  group_interval: 30s
  repeat_interval: 30s
  group_wait: 30s
  receiver: 'low_priority_receiver'  # Fallback.
  routes:
   - match:
       severity: critical
     receiver: high_priority_receiver
   - match:
       severity: warning
     receiver: low_priority_receiver

receivers:
- name: 'high_priority_receiver'
  webhook_configs:
    - send_resolved: true
      url: 'http://localhost:2000/high_priority_channel'
- name: 'low_priority_receiver'
  webhook_configs:
    - send_resolved: true
      url: 'http://localhost:2000/low_priority_channel'
```

## Debugging

For debugging purposes, you will see the JSON body received from Prometheus and the JSON body created to be sent to Microsoft Teams.

## Why

Alertmanager doesn't support sending to Microsoft Teams out of the box. Fortunately, they allow you to use a generic [webhook_config](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/configuration/#webhook_config) for cases like this. This project was inspired from [idealista's](https://github.com/idealista/) [prom2teams](https://github.com/idealista/prom2teams) which was written in Python.
